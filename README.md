## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques for Loan Lending System.

- What is the background of your project?

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Exploratory Data Science techniques. We will be understanding and solving a risk analytics problem in Banking and Financial Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like defaulters prediction in Loan Lending club

- Business Problem Statement:

We are working for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

1)If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2)If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The data given to us contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- 1.Lending Club will be in profit if they give more loan amount as interest rate increases with higher loan amount
- 2.A-grade is a top letter grade for a lender to assign to a borrower.Grades should be evaluated thoroughly before lending money
- 3.A derogatory item is an entry that may be considered negative by lenders because it indicates risk and hurts your ability to qualify for credit or other services. Public records and collections are derogatory items because they reflect financial obligations that were not paid as agreed.Those who already have pub_rec value 1 or 2 have charged off chances higher than who have no Derogatory Public Record.pub_rec count 3-4 has less numbers so cannot reach on any conclusions.
- 4.States NV,CA and FL states shows good number of charged offs in good number of applications.So, Lending Club should issue less loans in these states.
- 5.Those who are not working or have less than 1 year of work experience have high chances of getting charged off.So, Lending Club should issue less loans to these kind of applicants.
- 6.Small Business Owners default most.So, Lending Club should issue less loans to these kind of applicants.
